# Route Finder
**About**

Route Finder is a platform for users to discover bike rides around them, record new rides, and view past ridesrecorded or favorited.  It was coded largely as a way to experiment with using oAuth as well as websockets in order to broadcast location data so that users can record and save bike routes.

Users can record new rides on the app and view them later on their dashboard. Users can also search for new rides based on their preferred location, distance, and climb. The app also pulls in any Strava data so that they can view all of their activity and discovered rides in one place.
